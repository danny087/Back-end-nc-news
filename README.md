Welcome to the Northcoders News API! This is an api i made for my NC-news front end. The api has endpoint fetching data of articles,commets,topics and users. if a incorrect input is passed you will recive an error meassge telling you how to fix this issue.

For developers
Clone the source locally: https://github.com/danny087/BE2-northcoders-news.git

Install project dependencies:

$ npm install



Running tests

Open the spec folder

open spec.js

place a .only infront of any endpoint you would like to test.

run npm test in your terminal.

The data that comes back is from a mock mongo database which resembles the real database im using for my frontend northcoders news, the only differnece is the size of the database.
